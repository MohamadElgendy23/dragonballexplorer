The Dragon Ball API is a comprehensive REST API inspired by the iconic television series Dragon Ball. This API grants users access to an extensive database featuring hundreds of characters, images, transformations, and planets from the Dragon Ball universe. It encompasses canonical information derived from various series, including Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super, as well as films, and a touch of Dragon Ball Heroes."

This project is my way of combining my love for Dragon Ball with a commitment to supporting other Dragon Ball lovers by providing a helpful tool. It's a personalized initiative to make learning and exploring the Dragon Ball universe a bit more exciting and educational for everyone involved.
